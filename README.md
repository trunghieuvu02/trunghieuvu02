- 👋 Hi, I’m @trunghieuvu02
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning in Time Series data, Computer Vision in Manufacturing, Streaming data.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on predictive maintainance, remaining useful life (RUL). I use SOTA approaches such as Seq2Seq, Transformers with full attention, log sparse attention, and prob sparse attention (to be completed). The results are quite promissing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning applications with practical cases.
