- 👋 Hi, I’m @trunghieuvu02. I'm working as a KTP - Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer at ADC Ltd. in Scotland.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning in Time Series data, Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on predictive maintainance, remaining useful life (RUL). I use SOTA approaches such as Seq2Seq, Transformers with full attention, log sparse attention, and prob sparse attention (to be completed). The results are quite promissing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning applications with practical cases.
- 📫 How to reach me: h.vu1@rgu.ac.uk
